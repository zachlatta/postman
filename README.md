Postman is a command-line utility for batch sending email.

#### Features

* Fast, templated, bulk emails
* Reads template attributes from CSV
* Works with any SMTP server

##### Why this over `cat | sed | sendmail < bcc distro_list`?

* Supports both text and HTML parts in emails
* All of the power of templates in Go (conditionals, etc)
* Some SMTP providers will complain if there are too many emails in BCC
  (generally >1000)
* Sends emails concurrently
